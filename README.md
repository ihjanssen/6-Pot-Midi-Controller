# 6-Pot-Midi-Controller
Midi controller built with an Arduino Nano for my TH4555 (Audio Technology) final project in Fall 2022. Interfaces directly with my preferred parameters in DiscoDSP's
Oberheim-inspired software synthesizer OB-XD, but entirely compatible with any VST with midi-mappable parameters.
